# Student Record Management System Project
## Create a Python script that manages student records using tuples, sets, and frozen sets, and demonstrates various operations and methods.

### This project demonstrates the following concepts:
- Tuples: Student records are stored as tuples, representing their name, age, and grade.
- Tuple methods: The len() function is used to count the number of students, and the index() method is used to find the index of a specific student record.
- Sets: Sets are used to store unique student IDs and courses.
- Set operations: The update() method is used to add new student IDs to the existing set, and the - operator is used to find the remaining courses by subtracting the completed courses from the set of all courses.
- Frozen sets: Frozen sets are used to create immutable sets of courses and student data. Attempting to modify a frozen set will raise an AttributeError.

This project helped me practise and understand tuple methods, sets and set operations, as well as frozen sets.
